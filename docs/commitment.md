We ensure this tool is easy to use by dogfooding (using the Frenglish bot internally) our product regularly. This website is open-source for you to see how we implemented i18n for our webpages and serves as an example of the quality of our translations. Additionally, you can see how the bot creates the PRs for locale files.

We ensure great translation quality by going through many iterations of AI reflection, reviews, and learnings. If you make any modifications to a locale file that is not in the origin language, our AI will implicitly learn from these changes and apply them in future translations.

We regularly perform quality assurance tests on our translation files by running standardized translation tests like the METEOR score, sending them to human translators, and continuously gathering user feedback.
